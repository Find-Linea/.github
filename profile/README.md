## How does it work
- EFROGS: Users receive an EFROG NFT once they catch a rare frog across different levels. Users can also earn it through the Spinning Wheel.
- $CROAK: We deployed our own token on Linea Sepolia Network called tCROAK, which demonstrate how $CROAK can be used on the mainnet. The token supply is set to 2_015_000_000. It serves as the in-game currency. Users can use it for Spinning the wheel for 20 tCROAKS and earn 20 by completing the levels.
